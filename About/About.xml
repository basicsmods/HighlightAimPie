	<description>This mod does two things. 
	The first is that it makes the aim pies easier to see. Normally, they are a transparent white. This mod makes them a less transparent blue. 
	The second thing this mod does is change when they are drawn. Normally, aim pies are only drawn for things you have selected. This mod still keeps that same behaviour, but it also draws aim pies for any unselected enemies who are targeting a friendly pawn/mech.
	The motivation for this mod was to make it easier for me to notice when Centipedes are shooting at my pawns in Combat Extended.</description>
